# THUG PRO SOUNDTRACK GENERATOR

![](https://i.imgur.com/yjR8ZFe.png)

This program takes in a directory of music files and generates a .sound.json file based on the name, to be used as a THUG Pro soundtrack.

## Usage Instructions

1. Download the latest exe file
2. Put the exe file somewhere on your computer
3. Convert all your music files to .bik (see below)
4. If it's the first time you're running it, it will created a folder called "music files" for you. Drag all of your .bik files into this folder. They must be named with the artist name and song name, separated by a dash.
5. Enter the additional information prompted by the program.
6. A folder is exported 

## Creating .bik files

For you songs to work in game they must be .bik files. 

1. Download RAD Video Tools and install it
2. Open RAD Video Tools
3. Select one or more mp3 files
4. Click Bink it! at the bottom, click yes to the batch process prompt
5. Under compress audio, set the compress level to 0, the convert to rate to 44100, and the sound format to 16-bit/stereo.
6. Change the output file info at the top to a new folder to put the .bik files in (perhaps the "music files" folder created by this program)
7. Click Batch on the right

If your songs come out really small (like 10kb instead of 10mb), then something went wrong and they wont work in game. Re-encoding the MP3 file usually works. You can do this manually with the freeware Audacity, or you can use dBpoweramp Music Converter to reencode them as a batch.

## Getting them in game

1. Navigate to your THUG Pro install folder (usually "%LocalAppData%/THUG Pro")
2. In the user folder, drag and drop the .sound.json file generated by the program.
3. Drag the folder with all of the sound files
